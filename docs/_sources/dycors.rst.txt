DyCors
======

DYCORS (DYnamic COordinate search using Response Surfaces).

Version implemented here is DYCORS-LMSRBF (Local Metric Stochastic
Radial Basis Functions) [1]_. 

Both RBF (Radial Basis Functions) and GRBF (Gradient-enhanced Radial
Basis Functions) can be used. Three different kernels have been
implemented: exponential kernel, Mat√©rn kernel and cubic kernel.
